# CLAUDE.md

## Operating Standard

- Answer in the user's language
- Read the relevant chat history before acting.
- Be autonomous by default: inspect, decide, implement, validate, and report without unnecessary confirmation loops.
- Ask only when ambiguity blocks a safe decision, the product choice is genuinely open, or the action is risky/destructive enough that the user should explicitly choose.
- Do not hallucinate. Verify uncertain claims through code, scripts, docs, tests, runtime output, or repository evidence.
- Preserve unrelated user changes. Do not revert, overwrite, reformat, or clean up work you did not create unless explicitly asked.
- Prefer evidence over ceremony. Keep process proportional to the task.
- The job is not to sound smart. The job is to leave the system clearer, more correct, and easier to trust.

## Instruction Priority

- If instructions conflict, follow higher-priority system, developer, and user instructions first, then the nearest repository instructions.
- Safety, privacy, and preservation of user work take priority over speed or convenience.
- When editing this file, keep equivalent agent files such as `AGENTS.md` aligned unless the difference is intentional and documented.

## User Interaction

- Assume repository users are Vibe coders without programming experience. Do not ask them to evaluate technical implementations or choose which of two good engineering solutions is better.
- When user input is genuinely needed, frame the question as a product decision: describe the user experience, behavior, constraint, or tradeoff each option creates, then recommend one.
- Keep technical rationale concise and tied to product impact. Ask for confirmation only when the product outcome is truly open or the action is risky.

## Repository Grounding

- Start from the repository itself, not assumptions.
- For non-trivial work, read `README.md` and relevant `docs/` early for setup, architecture, runbooks, product constraints, and caveats.
- Trust current code, scripts, schemas, tests, and runtime output over stale docs. Call out doc drift and align it when practical.
- When relevant files or repository shape are unclear, get a fresh snapshot with `tree -L 2`, `tree -L 3`, or `rg --files`.
- Do not treat `README.md` as a file inventory. Discover structure dynamically.
- Use the repository's existing package manager, scripts, test runner, formatter, linter, build tools, and generators.
- Use `docs/LOCAL_DATABASE.md` and `docker-compose.yml` as the local PostgreSQL source of truth. Default to Docker Compose across Windows, macOS, and Linux; do not ask for native PostgreSQL setup unless the user explicitly chooses it.
- In Codex shell sessions, do not assume JS tooling is already on `PATH`. For `node`, `npm`, and `bun`, prefer `PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH"`.
- Do not add new production dependencies without explicit user approval unless the user directly requested that dependency by name. Prefer existing utilities, framework APIs, and the standard library.
  - Before implementing with a new library, inspect the relevant `package.json` first. Prefer established libraries already installed in this template, especially Zod, TanStack Query, TanStack Form, Hono, Prisma, Expo, and the shared `@hr-recruiter/contracts` package.
- If a missing dependency would clearly improve the product outcome, explain the user-visible reason and ask before installing it.
- Before using framework-specific APIs, check the current official documentation or local installed package types/examples, then write code to match the current API rather than memory.
- For E2E, use Playwright for web and Maestro for mobile. Read `docs/TESTING.md` before adding flows. Prefer valuable user-visible coverage over narrow happy-path-only smoke tests: cover critical journeys, high-risk regressions, auth/session behavior, persistence, navigation, and important empty/error/edge states when the test can stay stable and maintainable. Keep exhaustive validation matrices, combinatorial edge cases, concurrency, and pure business rules in integration/contract/unit tests.
- For mobile E2E selectors, prefer stable React Native `testID` constants from `mobile/src/constants/testIds.ts`; do not rely on coordinates or fragile text when an action selector can have an id.
- For Expo dev client + Maestro, run against an installed development build, not Expo Go. Open the app bundle with the dev-client `openLink` URL from `MAESTRO_DEV_SERVER_URL`, and preflight backend/Metro reachability before UI steps.
- For mobile E2E input stability, use `EXPO_PUBLIC_E2E=1` only in E2E bundles, keep production password fields secure, avoid `hideKeyboard`, center important CTA targets before taps, and keep custom touch targets around `44-48pt` or larger.
- After changing mobile Maestro flows, runner inputs, or E2E-only app behavior, run `bun run --cwd mobile e2e:maestro:audit` alongside the relevant typecheck/test/lint validation.

## Project Context

- Use `README.md` as the source of truth for first-run repository download, bootstrap, and product intake instructions.
- Keep durable project choices in README files and docs, not in this agent file.
- Infrastructure, deployment, storage, local database, testing runbooks, and provider-specific choices live in `README.md` and `docs/`. Keep this file focused on operating standards and pointers.
- When a surface is deferred, prefer a short note in that surface's README over extra agent instructions.
- Prefer a monolithic backend architecture in this repository. Do not split into microservices unless the product has a concrete operational need.
- For real-time infrastructure decisions, follow `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.

## Repository Remote Policy

- Inspect `git remote -v` before any branch, commit, push, or PR workflow.
- This repository is normally used as a template for a new project, not as a source for pull requests back to the template. If `origin` points to the template repository and the user has not explicitly said they are contributing to the template, remove it with `git remote remove origin`.
- Add the user's own GitHub repository as `origin` only when the user provides a URL or asks you to create/publish the project. If no destination is chosen, leave the project without `origin` and report that publishing is not configured.
- Do not push, open PRs, or configure deployment from the template remote by accident.

## Deployment Policy

- Deployment and infrastructure policy belongs in `README.md` and `docs/`, especially `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`, `docs/STORAGE.md`, `docs/LOCAL_DATABASE.md`, and `docs/YANDEX_CLOUD.md`.
- Concrete DigitalOcean spec defaults belong in `scripts/prepare-do-specs.mjs` and `.do/*.yaml.example`; update README/docs alongside those scripts instead of duplicating tier choices in this file.
- Before deployment work, read the relevant docs and use repository scripts/generators rather than provider details from memory.

## Storage And Media Policy

- Storage and media infrastructure policy belongs in `docs/STORAGE.md` and provider-specific deployment docs.
- Keep durable storage decisions in README/docs, not in this agent file.

## Task Mode

Classify the task before editing and scale the process to the task.

- `Review`: read-only evaluation, explanation, architecture review, or recommendations when the user has not asked for changes.
- `Direct`: cosmetic, copy, spacing, styling, comments, or obvious local edits that do not change runtime behavior.
- `Investigation`: diagnosis or debugging when the root cause or failure path is not yet clear.
- `TDD-first`: behavior, logic, contracts, auth, permissions, persistence, validation, query semantics, routing, state transitions, concurrency, or non-trivial user-facing changes.

For `Review` tasks, inspect relevant evidence, cite concrete files or behavior, report risks and recommendations, and do not edit files unless the user asks for implementation.

For `Direct` tasks, inspect the affected file and nearby usage, make the smallest coherent change, and run narrow validation when cheap and relevant.

For `Investigation` tasks, reproduce or trace the observed failure path when possible, use vertical and horizontal research before patching, identify the owning layer, and stop to reframe if two attempts fail to move the primary signal.

For `TDD-first` tasks, choose the highest-value failing test boundary already supported by the repo. Before implementation, identify the important success, failure, boundary, permission, persistence, and recovery edge cases; cover every important edge case with an automated test at the cheapest boundary that still catches the failure. Prefer E2E when the risk is user-visible and spans client/backend behavior, integration tests when behavior belongs to API/auth/persistence/contracts, and unit tests only when they provide clear extra signal for pure rules, schema matrices, security/token helpers, env parsing, or client retry/cache behavior. Keep the loop strict: failing case, minimal implementation, green, next case. If no suitable automated test exists and adding one is disproportionate, say so and use the fastest reliable validation path.

## Acceptance Contract

For non-trivial work, define a short acceptance contract when it clarifies scope:

- what “done” means;
- 3 to 5 observable pass/fail criteria;
- the primary signal, preferably user-visible or runtime behavior;
- secondary signals such as tests, typecheck, lint, build, logs, or targeted scripts.

Do not create ceremony for simple local tasks. Implement directly when the correct move is obvious and low-risk.

## Vertical And Horizontal Research

Before fixing non-trivial behavior, inspect both the runtime path and neighboring systems.

Vertical research follows the execution path:

- UI/caller -> route/guard/layout -> page/container/orchestrator -> hook/handler/service -> contract/API -> persistence/external system.
- Backend flow: request boundary -> validation -> auth/permission -> domain logic -> transaction/query -> serializer -> response.
- Async flow: trigger -> queue/job/task -> retry/idempotency -> side effect -> status/error visibility.

Horizontal research checks adjacent surfaces that must stay consistent:

- sibling routes, similar components, related hooks, shared services, schemas, serializers, tests, docs, and existing patterns;
- loading, empty, error, success, disabled, optimistic, retry, and stale-cache states;
- producer and consumer sides of contracts;
- read paths and write paths for persistence changes.

Do enough research to find the owner layer. Do not turn research into wandering.

## Root Cause Discipline

- Understand the failure path before patching symptoms; fix the owner layer, not the nearest visible symptom.
- If a bug appears in a child component, hook, helper, or leaf function, inspect the parent or owning layer before adding local compensation.
- Reject child-side fallbacks, defensive state repair, duplicated decision logic, flags, or wrappers that hide an upstream mistake.
- Treat one-file fixes for cross-layer behavior as suspicious until proven otherwise.
- If the smallest diff and the correct diff diverge, choose the correct diff with the smallest system-wide footprint.
- A change is not minimal if it makes the code harder to understand tomorrow.
- If re-architecture or migration is required, state scope, risks, backward compatibility, and rollout order.

## Change-Surface Triggers

When touching a boundary, inspect and align directly coupled code.

- Shared contracts or schemas: validate producer and consumer sides.
- Routes, guards, redirects, or layouts: inspect protected/public flows, parent orchestration, and navigation side effects.
- Queries, mutations, or fetch contracts: inspect keys, invalidation, loading, empty, error, success, optimistic, and stale states.
- Schema or persistence behavior: inspect contract shape, serializers, migrations, generated client usage, read paths, and write paths.
- Auth or permission logic: inspect guards, loaders, session shape, backend enforcement, and affected user-visible states.
- Async workflows: inspect retries, idempotency, ordering, cancellation, and failure visibility.
- User-facing copy with legal, billing, privacy, security, or support meaning: preserve the product contract and flag ambiguity.

## Minimal Sufficient Change

- Aim for the smallest coherent change that fully solves the real problem at the owning layer.
- Minimal means minimal surface area, moving parts, and abstraction count, not smallest diff at any cost.
- Prefer flat, simple implementations over extra layers, folders, patterns, and abstractions.
- Prefer local clarity over clever reuse.
- Prefer decoupling over DRY. Small intentional duplication is better than the wrong shared abstraction.
- Do not add abstractions, helpers, hooks, services, wrappers, folders, scripts, or generators unless they remove real current complexity.
- Split code only when it clearly improves comprehension or isolates responsibility.
- Delete obsolete escape hatches when a clearer ownership model replaces them.
- Do not build framework-like architecture for small features.

## Documentation Discipline

- Code is the primary source of truth for implementation details.
- `README.md` and `docs/` should capture durable context: architecture, workflows, operational constraints, runbooks, caveats, and non-obvious decisions.
- Do not mirror code structure in docs, maintain exhaustive file inventories by hand, or create doc churn for trivial refactors, obvious code movement, formatting, or self-evident details.
- Update docs when a change materially affects architecture, setup, operations, contracts, user flows, or important engineering decisions.
- After implementation, check whether durable knowledge should be added or aligned.
- If relevant doc drift remains out of scope, call it out explicitly.

## Testing And Validation

- Run the smallest meaningful validation that covers the changed surface.
- Prefer cheap gates first: targeted tests, typecheck, lint, build, focused scripts, then wider suites only when needed.
- Use test infrastructure already present in the repository. Do not invent a heavier test layer unless clearly justified.
- For non-trivial behavior, explicitly account for important edge cases in the test plan or acceptance contract; if an important edge case is not automated, explain why.
- Before adding or expanding E2E, apply an ROI check: the test should prevent a plausible user-visible regression, use stable selectors and isolated test data, avoid brittle timing or text coupling, and earn its maintenance cost.
- Validate after implementation and before closing the task.
- If contracts or shared schemas change, validate both producer and consumer sides.
- Treat non-zero exits, runtime errors, unhandled promise rejections, failed assertions, type errors, lint errors, build failures, and timeouts as failed validation.
- Do not declare success on proxy metrics alone. Green tests, lint, or typecheck are not enough if the primary user-visible signal is still broken.
- If only secondary signals were checked, report the task as partially validated.
- If validation cannot be run, say why and identify the best available substitute signal.
- Do not hide validation failures. Report what failed, what it means, and the next useful experiment.

## Prisma Migration Policy

- Do not hand-write Prisma migration SQL in this repository.
- Express schema changes declaratively in `schema.prisma` using Prisma features such as `@unique`, indexes, relations, defaults, and enums.
- Generate migrations with the Prisma workflow already used by the repository.
- Do not author or customize `migration.sql` by hand unless explicitly asked.
- If extra safety checks, backfills, preconditions, or rollout guards are needed, implement them in the owning backend layer, endpoint flow, or existing repository-supported workflow.

## UI And Design

- Follow the existing design system, component primitives, and styling conventions.
- Preserve the existing visual language unless explicitly asked for a redesign.
- Prefer parent padding plus container gap for layout rhythm over ad hoc margins.
- Keep spacing on the shared scale. Avoid one-off values unless visually justified.
- Treat shared visual components as visually closed units: surface, padding, radius, internal spacing, typography, and control sizing belong to the component itself.
- Compose shared components from the outside through wrappers, not visual overrides.
- If a consumer needs different treatment, prefer existing semantic props, then the smallest reusable semantic prop, then a local feature-level wrapper.
- Do not bypass established primitives with ad hoc surfaces when a shared primitive owns that role.
- For frontend bugs, inspect the full flow: route, guard, layout, page, container, query, hook, handler, service, component, client contract, API, and persistence.

## Safety And Workspace Hygiene

- Never stop or kill processes just to free ports. Use isolated ports, alternate URLs, or test config overrides.
- Do not propose or implement CI/CD, hosted automation, deployment pipelines, or release ceremony unless explicitly asked.
- Add automation only when it removes real repeated pain, not when it merely looks mature.
- Do not print secrets, tokens, private keys, credentials, cookies, customer data, or raw `.env` values in final responses.
- Do not add real secrets to fixtures, tests, docs, screenshots, logs, or committed files.
- Keep ad-hoc investigation artifacts out of the repository root. Put temporary screenshots, logs, and one-off exports under `./.scratch/` or the tool-owned artifact directory, and do not create new root-level `.tmp-*` or `.codex-tmp-*` files.
- Do not weaken auth, permissions, validation, encryption, rate limits, or auditability to make a task easier.
- Do not manually edit generated files unless the repository explicitly requires it. Update the source and run the generator instead.
- Do not stage, commit, amend, rebase, reset, stash, push, or delete files unless explicitly asked.
- Keep diffs focused. Avoid unrelated formatting churn.

## Decision Rules

- If the solution is obvious and low-risk, execute it.
- If material product or architecture tradeoffs exist, present up to two viable options and recommend one.
- If a safe assumption unblocks work, proceed and state the assumption in the final report.
- If an action is destructive, irreversible, security-sensitive, privacy-sensitive, or likely to affect unrelated users or data, ask before doing it.
- If the target behavior is still not achieved, say what is still wrong, why, and the best next experiment.

## Completion Protocol

At the end of every implementation or investigation, report the items that matter for the task. For `Direct` or read-only `Review` tasks, compress this to the relevant fields only.

- what changed and why;
- root cause, when identified;
- affected layers;
- validation performed;
- `Primary signal status`: met, not met, or partially validated;
- `Secondary signal status`: exact checks run and what they showed;
- documentation status: updated, not needed, or still needs alignment;
- remaining risks, missing coverage, or follow-up work when relevant;
- migration or rollout implications when contracts, schemas, persistence, auth, routing, or architecture changed;
- a concise suggested commit message when the change is ready.

A task is not done if the visible symptom is gone but the same mechanic remains structurally inconsistent across directly coupled layers.
